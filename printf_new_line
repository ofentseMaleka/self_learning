we're going to type a printf statement that also produce another text on a new line.
in order to have a new line we include a \n, this is seen as an escape a line

I already know how to:
- Print text to the screen.
- Start a new line.
- Fix errors.

we will  e using these statements to print them on a new line

here we go 

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void){

	printf("I already know how to");
	printf("- Print text to the screen.");
	printf("- Start a new line.");
	printf("- Fix errors.");
	return 0;
}
